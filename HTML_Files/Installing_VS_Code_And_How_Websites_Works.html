    => Installing VS_Code and Ow websites works.

    => Intalling VS_Code.
        -> We can use any text editor of our choice. Here I am using VS_Code editor because it is light weight, open source & from Microsoft.
        -> Goto google, type VS_Code & install it.
        -> Follow this like to diownload directly:- "https://code.visualstudio.com/download"

        -> Note:- You can write HTML even in Notepad Text Editor like VS_Code just makes these things easier.

    => How Websites works ?
        -> There are three person let's assume to understand How websites are works.
            1. Client.
            2. Server.
            3. Browser.

            * Client -> Browser -> Server |Then| Server -> Brower -> Clent
                -> It means - Client(user) will request to the browser then brower will interrect with the server then server will give the brower any response recarding the client request the brower will show, what server will give the brower. then client(user ) will interrect with that requested things on the screen in the browser.
            -> that's the anomoty of Working websites.
