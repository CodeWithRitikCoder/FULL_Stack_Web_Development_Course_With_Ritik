                => HTML Entities in HTML.
                    ->HTML entities are a crucial part of HTML markup language. They enable you to display characters that are reserved in HTML or that aren't readily available on the keyboard. In this blog, we'll explore what HTML entities are, their types, and how to use them.
                
                => What are HTML Entities ?
                    -> HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

                => Why use HTML Entities ?
                    -> Here are some reasons:
                        * Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
                        * Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
                        * Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line.
                
                => Common HTML Entities.
                    -> &lt;  for <
                    -> &gt;  for >
                    -> &amp; for &
                    -> &nbsp; for a non-breaking space
                    -> &copy; for ©

                => How to Use HTML Entities.
                    -> Entities can be implemented easily within HTML code. Here are some examples:

                     => Using Reserved Characters.
                        -> <p>The price is 10 &lt; 20.</p>

                     => Displaying Special Symbols
                        -> <p>Copyright &copy; 2023.</p>

                     => Creating Non-Breaking Spaces
                        -> <p>This is an example&nbsp;text.</p>
