    => Important and Basic things related to HTML.
        1. what is index.html ?
            -> we start building a website by creating a file named [index.html].
            -> [index.html] is a special fileName which root address is typed.
        
        2. Flow of HMTL Code.
            -> HTML Document =========> Browser =========> Rendered page

        3. Important notes.
            -> Head & body tags are the childres of the HTML tag.
            -> HTML is the parent of Head & body tags.
            -> Most of the HTML documents have opening & closing tag.
            -> Some HTML tags have no content. these are called Empty elements. e.g-> <br>, <hr> and so on...
            -> We can either user [.html] or [.htm] extension for the HTML file.
            -> We can use "Inspect element" or "View page source" option from the browser to look in to a website's HTML code.
        
        4. What is tags in HTML ?
            -> HTML tags are the hidden keywords with in a web page that define how web browser must format and display the content.

            -> There are two types of Tags in HTML.
                1. Empty tag/ Continer tag => like as:- <img>, <br>, <hr> and so on....
                2. Non-Empty tag => like as:- <html></html>, <u></u> and so on....

        5. Flow of HTML tag's Element.
            -> HTML_Element = start_Tag + Content + End_Tag.
            -> and A Tag is like a contianer for either content or other HTML Tags.

        6. Case Sensitivity of HTML code.
            -> HTML is a case insensitive language.
            like as:- <h1> and <H1> -> tags are the same.

        7. Comments in HTML.
            -> Comments in HTML are used to make text which should not be parsed. They can help document the sourse code.

        8. HTML Attributes.
            -> HTML Attributes are used to add more information corresponding to tan HTML tag.
                like as:- <a href="https://RitikCoder.com/">RitikCoder</a> -> In the ancher tag href is a [href Attribute].
            -> We can either use single or double quotes in attributes.
